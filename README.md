# Machine Learning Regression Models

This repository contains implementations and examples of three fundamental regression techniques in machine learning: **Linear Regression**, **Lasso Regression**, and **Logistic Regression**. These models are widely used for predictive analysis and classification tasks.

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of regression models through code implementations, visualizations, and practical examples. Each model is accompanied by a brief theoretical background and usage instructions.

## Models

### Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

#### Key Features:
- Simple and intuitive
- Assumes a linear relationship between variables
- Suitable for continuous dependent variables

### Lasso Regression

Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term. This term penalizes the absolute size of the coefficients, which can lead to simpler models and prevent overfitting.

#### Key Features:
- Performs variable selection
- Reduces model complexity
- Suitable for high-dimensional datasets

### Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is used for binary classification problems. It models the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class using the logistic function.

#### Key Features:
- Outputs probabilities between 0 and 1
- Suitable for binary classification
- Can be extended to multiclass problems
